# ironshade
This is a small project that we (IronShade) made in our hackathon, hackDTU held on 11th of Febuary 2017. 

There are two parts to this project:
1) A simple, REST-API which takes/renders in the names and details of medicines.
2) An OCR app that scans and then sends the name of the data to the API which in return renders the details of the medicine to the user.

It was made under immense time constraints and pressure so it might not be accurate in it's form and function.

I, along with my partners in that hackathon would try to make it better overtime.

Cheers ;)
